Tests for QUINN SMS functionality
---------------------------------
These tests will not work in isolation; the class must be created to get the
class long code that will be used in the next test, for example. Run these
tests sequentially unless there is a blocking failure.

Requires: Fixed (QUINN) long code: _________________
Requires: Two cell phones with SMS capability (teacher and student)
Requires: clean database (class named in test #1 does not exist)

1. Create class
User: teacher

Action: Text "Ms. Case's Android Class" to QUINN long code
Expect: text reply with class long code and a password

2. Sign up for class notifications
User: student

Action: Text 'join' to the class long code
Expect: reply containing a request for student's name
Action: reply to that text with student's name
Expect: text confirmation message

3. Messages from teacher go to student
User: teacher

Action: send a text message to class long code
Expect: All signed-up students' phones get that message

4. Messages from student go to teacher
User: student

Action: send a text message to class long code
Expect: teacher's phone gets that message
Expect: no student's phone gets that message

5. Scale users for a class
Action: repeat tests 2 through 4 adding more students
Expect: all tests still pass

6. Scale classes
Action: repeat tests 1 through 5 with unique class titles
Expect: all tests still pass
